# robot_simulator
Robot control and simulation app designed with MATLAB APP Designer

This repository depends on the Peter Corke Robotics Toolbox as can be installed here: https://petercorke.com/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox/.
This project also requires MATLAB app designer be installed.

With the dependencies installed, the app will allow the user to input the configuration of any robot and will return the equations of motion, control simulations, and kinematic simulations.
